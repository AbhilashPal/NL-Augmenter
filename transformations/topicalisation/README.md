## What type of a transformation is this?
In linguistics, Topicalisation was actually used as a constituency test (i.e. whether an expression can be deemed as a constituent) but has lately been explored as one way to change the word order of a sentence.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs depend on the accuracy of dependency parsing. Besides, noisy sentences or sentences which do not conform to standard English syntax might not produce great candidates.
